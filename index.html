      <p> PolitiColor is an app that converts tweets into sentiment information on the 2016 Presidential Election. Using a chroropleth map, Twitter opinions expressed in tweets are color coded and mapped by state. Users can quickly view sentiment data on their favorite candidates, or on general sentiment between the two major parties. When Twitter opinion in a state swings in favor of a candidate, their color appears more prominantly; if the opposite occurs, the opposing color is displayed.
      <br>
      <br>
      PolitiColor is just in time for election season. With campaigns and the country gearing up for the first caucuses and primaries, Politicolor provides a unique outlet for information that is difficult to gather and arguably more accurate than the tried and true method of polls. Politicolor is real time and digital; it can be accessed everywhere and is constantly updating. As a result, even the most tireless of political junkies can get their fill of data and analytics.

      <p> Twitter is in many ways the heartbeat of the population. Where most people see social media, Politicolor sees data. By tracking thousands of tweets per hour, Politicolor can one-up polls and get a more accurate representation of how people actually feel. </p> 
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1">
      <p class='quadTitle'>The Engine</p>
      <p> The Engine is the centerpiece of Politicolor. To function, Politicolor needs to convert the barely-english of Twitter into something readable for machines. The Engine, composed of a unique machine learning POS algorithm, does just that.</p> 
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1" id="quad2">
      <p class='quadTitle'>The Calculator</p>
      <p> Each individual tweet is a small drop in a huge ocean; to see real data connections, Politicolor uses The Calculator to aggregate the data and draw out meaningful information.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1">
    <p class='quadTitle'> The Map</p>
      <p> There is a lot of information being distilled and displayed very rapidly, so design and polish must be the watchwords of Politicolor. The Map above, built to be easily understood, works to draw the user in.</p>

            PolitiColor relies on the sentiment engine that powers the natural language processing backend. Here, we break down the engine pipeline to get a better look at what is happening under the hood. NLP here consists of a series of normalization parameters, followed by keyword tagging, and finally sentiment calculation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tweets come in from Twitter queries that is related to the political information we are looking for. The Twitter query alone acts as our first filter, ensuring that we are not picking up the daily tweets irrelevant to politics. Each tweet is then filtered against readable location information that can be converted into a state. This leaves about 50 thousand tweets per hour at its peak. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Each tweet is then passed into the sentiment engine. First, the engine normalizes the tweets by replacing slang and emoticons where appropriate, and tagging words that need to be grouped in order to be relevant (e.g. 'Tea-Party' vs 'Tea Party'). Next, the engine looks for keywords in the tweet that may be relevant to the data points we are looking for, and tags the tweet with any keywords it finds. Finally, the tweet is broken down into parts of speech and passed into a sentiment calculator that was manually trained with about 30 thousand tweets. The sentiment calculator converts the tweet into a number - a sentiment - related to the keywords that were tagged previously.
            <br>
            <br>
            At this point, the data is considered processed and the tweet information is passed along to the aggregator for further analysis.
