      <p> PolitiColor is an app that visualizes the opinions of twitter users toward the 2016 presidential candidates. Using a chroropleth map, the opinions expressed in tweets are color coded so that the states' feelings towards various candidates are easily understood. The obvious uses of this app are readily apparent: to gauge the opinions of the American public toward the 2016 presidential candidates But the technology behind this program can be used in various other places. We used a map visualization, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Twitter data can be portrayed in various forms and it can also be searched for other words than political ones. Twitter is one of the best forums for judging what popular opinion really is, and we tap into this data to bring you this information.

      <p class='quadTitle'>The Hose</p>
      <p> Twitter is in many ways the heartbeat of the population. Where most people see social media, Politicolor sees data. By tracking thousands of tweets per hour, Politicolor can one-up polls and get a more accurate representation of how people actually feel. </p> 
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1">
      <p class='quadTitle'>The Engine</p>
      <p> The Engine is the centerpiece of Politicolor. To function, Politicolor needs to convert the barely-english of Twitter into something readable for machines. The Engine, composed of a unique machine learning POS algorithm, does just that.</p> 
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1" id="quad2">
      <p class='quadTitle'>The Calculator</p>
      <p> Each individual tweet is a small drop in a huge ocean; to see real data connections, Politicolor uses The Calculator to aggregate the data and draw out meaningful information.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class = "quad1">
    <p class='quadTitle'> The Map</p>
      <p> There is a lot of information being distilled and displayed very rapidly, so design and polish must be the watchwords of Politicolor. The Map above, built to be easily understood, works to draw the user in.</p>

      <div class = "textboxes">

           
      <p> The Sentiment engine works by normalizing and filtering tweets, putting them in a more usable format.</p> 
      <p> Then, the cleaned data is analyzed in chunks of words and phrases.</p> 
      <p> This parsed data is then given a number, which corresponds to a color and candidate. These colors are then displayed on the map of the United States in an easily understandable format.
      </p>
      <p> Pretty simple, right? 
      </p>
      <p> <i> Wrong. </i>  
      </p>
      <p> We built the natural language processing system and algorithm (IS THIS WHAT WE'RE DOING I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO EXPLAIN IT) from scratch, and EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS DIFFICULT.
